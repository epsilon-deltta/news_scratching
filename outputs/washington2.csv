0,Readers critique The Post: Abysmal coverage of the Paralympic Games,,,,"[""Asner’s dangerous activism\n...At a time when our democracy is threatened by widespread belief in conspiracy theories, it’s a mistake to give a pass to celebrities who trade in them.  I enjoyed Asner’s Lou Grant character as much as any of my fellow boomers, but I’ve been around long enough to know that talented entertainers are often idiots about politics.  Peter Blau, Belmont, N.C.\nAsner's activism was the public face of his belief in Marxism, communism and his membership in the Democratic Socialists of America.  None of this was secret but the mainstream media, as in the Washington Post, was happy not to reveal any of this to its readers.  \n\nhttps://www.keywiki.org/Ed_Asner"", 'Peter Blau responds:\n\nRespectfully, belief in Marxism/communism/socialism -- while perhaps reflecting a profound ignorance of history -- isn\'t toxic in the same way as peddling 9/11 conspiracy theories, and similar idiocies like vaccines containing Microsoft chips.\n\nUnlike the 1930s and 1940\'s, Marxism has a tiny following in the U.S. today; in my experience they\'re mostly old codgers like the late Mr. Asner. Few minds are being changed when fogies like this stand up for the despots in Cuba or Nicaragua.\n\n9/11 ""truthers"" however, make up a mass movement --- 1 in 6 Americans or over 40 million adults, if stats in this Wapo piece are to be believed.  Adherents are almost as likely to be Republicans as Democrats these days, and -- yes -- media celebrities are super-spreaders of this disease.\n\n  https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/10/false-toxic-sept-11-conspiracy-theories-are-still-widespread-today/', 'Fortunately I am able to see the video of Ashleigh Babbit being shot.

If you repeatedly flee the police and threaten them with a deadly weapon (car) while failing to comply with lawful orders, you might get shot.  Both Babbitt and Ghaisar brought it on themselves.', ""To Joseph Capone: Bro, have you SEEN the video of Babbitt's shooting? What the hell else was the officer supposed to do? Let her and the mob through? Being anti-police brutality and excessive force is good, but this isn't that."", 'Capone’s comment on “inconsistent editorials” clearly represents his pro-insurrection Trumpian views.  Comparing the police shooting of Bijapur Ghaisar to defending the U.S. government is false.  I don’t know about Mr. Capone, but I saw Ashli Babbitt attempting to bash her way into the chamber at the behest of her co-conspirators when she was shot.  There’s no dispute there.  As far as we know, Mr. Capone may have been there as one of those encouraging Babbitt to invade the chamber.  His beef should be with the cowards who used Babbitt to lead the way because she was the best choice, based on her size, to make it through the windowed door.  We know what happened.  We saw it.  Denying the facts (like “the big lie”) won’t change the truth.  Babbitt was a criminal.', 'In the NYT, there is an opinion piece by a veteran Republican conservative who says that what is happening now makes permanent the severance between the Trump party of former Republicans, on the one hand, and actual conservatives on the other. He says that the 1/6 coup was only, to use a phrase of my devising, half vast. But now the Trump cult is working hard, in legislatures and elsewhere across the land, to bring the coup to fulfillment. The martyrdom of that criminal woman is just part of this larger de facto conspiracy in plain sight.\n\nThese people are traitors, and they must be stopped. They think that God has so blessed their noble cause that they are now free to become anarchists and violent nihilists. But God did not, and they are not. The ones who commit crimes will go to prison. This is America, and they are dead wrong, even if their general cause has merit.', 'Lt. Col. McGrath, Marine combat aviator, does not appear to have perped the large technical error in this excerpt from the letter: ""a model of a World War II fighter plane, the P-47 Thunderbolt, which was referred to as a \'turboprop.\'” \n\nNote the passive voice--the omission of information about exactly who did the referring.\n\nIt appears that the author of the article, not the colonel, did the referring. The article said that as a kid, McGrath ""built a model of a P-47 Thunderbolt turboprop, a brawny fighter bomber, and researched the plane’s role in the European theater.""\n\nThis shows why editors and English teachers hold passive voice in low esteem.

1,Alexander Zverev allegedly abused his girlfriend. Tennis officials don’t seem to care.,,,,"['And she stayed with him for over a year?              \nWow!

There are several issues with it. \n- The ATP is not a league like NFL or MLB, the tennis players are not salaried by the league but freelancers. Furthermore, the ATP oversees the organization of tournaments in dozens of countries on every continent. Each rule relating to investigations of personal conduct violations and not strictly related to what happens on the tennis court must take into account the laws of the different countries.\n- The article assumes that Zverev is guilty. It explicitly states that it is up to Zverev to find proof of his innocence not to the prosecution to prove the case, because the ex-girlfriend\'s words are more than enough. And it states that given that it\'s ""only"" asked that he would stop playing, that is, that he would be canceled, not that he would go to jail, no real evidence is needed. That\'s obscene.\n- The article compares penalties imposed by the ATP for acts that occurred in the playing court with penalties that should be imposed for actions carried out in private. But nothing says that a tennis player must be a good person or a good citizen. To play tennis, he must only be a good player. If he commits crimes he will have to pay for them in court of justice not on a tennis court.', 'The ATP is the employer of all participants in their tournaments by contract.  Each participant receives 2.85 million dollars for participating with a chance to win a large bonus for winning the tournament.   The ATP has a policy against acts of violence committed on site of the tournament.  The accuser claims the abuse happened in a hotel room, provided by ATP, during the tournament.  The ATP can choose not to investigate these accusations, but they may suffer financially from fans and employees that wish they would.  They would also be liable for civil damages if he assaults one of their employees.  As they cannot now claim they had no way of knowing he might be violent.   That is the choice USA Gymnastics went with when they chose to ignore allegations of abuse by Larry Nassar.   They may regret that decision soon.', 'The ATP is not the employer of tennis players, at most it is their union.\nIt is absolutely false that the ATP pays 2,85 million dollars for participating.. to what? To the tour? To specific tournaments? There are players after n.150 in the ranking that can hardly make ends meet. Tournaments are not organized by ATP with the exception of the ATP Finals. Local tournament organizers pay for the players ospitality. All ATP rules are related to the tennis events not to the private life of players. So a player can be squalified if he takes drugs or loses matches for money or if he threatens or hits an umpire, not if he robs a bank. ATP is definitely not liable for anything that happens in these hotel rooms. For example for the US Open maybe the responsibility could be of the USTA that organizes the tournament, but even there, they are not liable if a player hits his coach for example. This has nothing to do with USA Gymnastic. Basically everything you wrote is wrong and shows a lack of knowledge of tennis. Also, ATP is an international organization and very few countries are obsessed by cancel culture like US. You should not want to impose American mentality everywhere.', 'Thanks for this important alternative view and info. It suggests directions for cross-checking the argument in the article.

What a court of law will do, if the accused is found guilty, imprison, fine or put on house arrest this person.  If there is enough credible suspicion which will affect the official body and the sport, suspension is jistified.', 'It is not a matter of getting a pass, it is that workplaces should not act as tribunal that judge the morality of the workers.

You Americans think that your Cancel Culture should be Law enforced everywhere but the rest of the world is not following you in this.', 'Many countries do not give employers the right to choose whom they hire and fire.

Do we believe that if Zverev were charged with throwing a tv out a hotel window that the ATP would claim to be powerless to investigate? Me neither!', 'Naomi Osaka was not fired by anybody anywhere.\nIf Zverev robbed a bank he would have problems with the law not with the ATP.

', 'So what will it take for the ATP to pay attention to the allegations? For Zverev to the girlfriend? She might have not gone to police because he threatened her. Or for fear of being exposed and mistreated by media and the public like so many other women have been. This reminds me of Oscar Pistorius. The ATP should be looking into this or it will come back to haunt it.

Zverev is diabetic and was monitoring his glucose. Is Rothenberg trying to be the next Ronan Farrow? I'm sorry that Sharypova chose Rothenberg as the messenger, threw away her cell phone, and chose never to go to the police because these things make it harder for the public to believe her.

Because they care about the safety of their female employees?', 'Sorry, but this isn\'t persuasive. In the examples provided here where sports organizations did act to sanction players, the evidence was available: video of the player ""trash talking,"" carrying the prohibited bag or whatever. Here it\'s not. Photos of bruises might seem persuasive, but there\'s the question of proving they were inflicted by the person charged, the circumstances in which the violence happened, and so forth. That\'s beyond the capacity of a sports organization. It\'s a criminal matter.The argument here is basically to lower the bar of evidence in order to allow sanctions to happen. But isn\'t that a violation of fairness? It\'s like ""due process"" has become something to sneer at: a fusty old preoccupation of authorities entangled in patriarchal conspiracy. There\'s something to the objection of patriarchal bias, but it doesn\'t extend to removing the protections and presumption of innocence that support our entire legal system.', 'You are incorrect about the level of evidence that sports leagues often have before suspending a player. The NFL is notorious for not taking any action until they absolutely have to, but MLB is generally much more proactive. Note, for instance, that Trevor Bauer is still suspended.', 'Thanks for the clarification. I thought of Bauer, although he had more than one accuser and at least one restraining order against him, so there was more ""there"" there. A suspension with pay might make sense while a case is sorted out, as it is with Bauer. However, the writer here seems to be arguing for league action whether or not there\'s a legal case. That strikes me as very different. \n\nNormally I\'m very much on the woman\'s side in these ugly affairs, knowing the context - endemic bias against her, the unlikelihood of false charges.

Sexism? What sexism?\n\nDjokovic is no quitter and while he has had lapses in sportsmanship as most top competitors have, including women, he has never had excuses at the ready. He builds school for kids-both boys and girls-and yet he is reviled, while Serena gets lauded for her girls only charity along with seemingly everything else. She is called a role model but has called men stupid and inept, among other things-can you imagine if a male tennis player said similar things about women?

Let it go. ', ""He's a great player. He can win a hundred Grand Slams and he will never be in the same class of player as Federer and Nadal, both of whom comport themselves with dignity and grace and show respect for the game and their opponents.\nNot Novak.\nAfter Djokovic's temper tantrum a couple of years ago when he smashed a ball in anger after a call he didn't like, he hit a linesman in the eye who needed medical attention. That is not the action of a gentleman.  He should have been banned for a year.\nThe Ty Cobb analogy is quite correct.\n\nNote: Monica Seles might have won a few more if she hadn't been stabbed by a crazed Graf fan. Obviously, not Graf's fault but she did benefit by having Seles out of the picture."", 'He has never developed the fan base of a Federer or Nadal, partly due to his somewhat grating personality.

Check your facts before making a public accusation. Djokovic's unfortunate striking of a lineswoman in the throat with a ball at last year's US Open was inadvertent, as described in the article above."", 'I don’t like him. He’s kind of a jerk. He’s  foolishly anti-vaccine. \n\nBut he sure can play tennis. He, Rafa, and Roger have each run up more majors than any other men.

Graf quit at a young age. \n\nIt matters not only how many majors you won, but also how consistently great was your competition. \n\nThe three guys at 20 are magnificent. Novak will likely end up with the most majors. Like him or not, he has a legit claim as the best ever. \n\nA bit like Ty Cobb. Admired and acknowledged as a player, but rightly reviled as a person.

Shots, yes, but also mind",,,,"[""I respect that Djokovic has continually worked to improve his game to the point that his opponents, including the great Rafael Nadal, have no clear method to beat him.  Uncle Toni has stated as much in interviews.\n\nRoger Federer had his one-handed backhand exposed by Rafael Nadal at the Miami Open (in a straight sets loss 3-6, 3-6) in March 2004 yet RF never fixed it.  Watch any Nadal-Federer or Djokovic-Federer match and see Nadal or Djokovic prey on Federer's backhand, allowing Nadal and Djokovic to own Federer in the Majors 10 to 4.  In a podcast with Andy Murray during this pandemic, Rafa described his strategy against Roger: just hit it to his backhand.\n\nRafael Nadal has a more complete game than Federer, but his serve has rarely earned him free points.""]"
