Glad Atkins will be back. Not sure about the status of Hines-Allen. Hopefully, they will determine the cause of her health issue and that's its treatable. We can definitely use her but even if she isn't available Mystics have what they  need to win. Shock everyone and get in the playoffs and keep it rolling. Go Mystics. "", 'I don’t think you have to worry about the Liberty. They blew a 12 point, fourth quarter lead in Dallas yesterday. Take out the first five games of the season, when the Liberty went 5-0 and the Fever went 0-5, and since then the Liberty have been the worst team in the league. They have no post defense, and Tina Charles should feast on her former team.']"
