2,Japan‚Äôs leader Yoshihide Suga to step down after just one year in office,,,,"['Japanese politics and business have always been hierarchical with descendants of daimyo families on the top and Suga is not one of them. He is a care taker for his lord Abbe and never had enough supports among the nobles within the party. ', ""It's not rocket science to figure out what's happening in Japanese politics that led to Prime Minister Suga's announcement that he is not seeking reelection. Suga became a liability for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party because he could not halt the spread of Covid-19 and his popularity poll dropped to 30%. The party leaders who chose Suga over Kishida a year ago, despite Prime Minister Abe's support for Kishida, now in all probability came together to support former foreign minister Kishida. Suga tallied his crumbling support among the faction leaders and saw that he could not win the next party leadership role. Thus, he called it quits. Deputy PM Aso's protege is Taro Kono, another obvious candidate to be PM. Abe and Kishida probably made a deal with Aso/Kono that after Kishida becomes PM, they will throw their support to Kono. He is young enough to wait his turn. You have to lift the curtain of Liberal Democratic Party politics in order to see the faction leaders vying for power. Then there is a general election: the many opposition parties are so fractured and fragmented that there is no chance to win. Thus, Kishida becomes the next prime minister. The bottom line is that a maverick like Trump will never be PM. These candidates are thoroughly seasoned, educated professionals. "", ""Suga is a nice person and I wish him well and enjoy his retirement. He must be tired in Japanese politics. My father and my mother studied in Tokyo, Japan from 1908-1919 and they became experts on Japan. They like Japan and my older brother was born in Tokyo. My father went to Japan because president Yuan Shih-kai picked him and wanted to train him to be an expert on Japan. My father was an expert on Japan and he handled all Japanese relations for China.

But Sakai was executed by Chiang Kai-shek after WWII in Nanking. "", 'I wonder if Abe will do a comeback? Suga was just incompetent in the position.

Lol. If only Trump had felt that way.', ""The next prime minister of Japan has already been decided behind the curtain of the Liberal-Democratic party politics. Whoever leads a major faction and gains the support of the other factions usually becomes prime minister. This time it will be former foreign minister Kishida who has probably already won the support of the major factions. That's why the current prime minister decided not to run for reelection when the other factions made it clear that they will support Kishida. I guessed correctly after Prime Minister Abe resigned to give way to Suga. And this time, with a push behind the scenes of Abe and Aso and other faction leaders, Kishida will win the party leadership and face a weak collection of opposition parties.

I seriously doubt this decision was made by Suga personally.
