0,Naomi Osaka’s return to tennis is an open question; her impact on mental-health awareness is clear,,,,"['Ms Clarke:\n\nMs Osaka took her eye off her athletic focus and fell under the spell of activist groups who used and confused her.\n\nThere is plenty of time, after her playing days are over, to make mature life decisions regarding politics and civic life.\n\nThe 20-something activist, in her/his 60s-70s will ponder, ""what was I thinking back then?""', 'As someone who lives with mental illness, I hope Osaka isn’t confusing fear of losing with an actual mental health disorder.  I am not judging. I’m just hopeful that normal anxiety doesn’t become the go to for athletes who are uncomfortable with losing. ', 'I think she\'s experiencing the common malaise of tennis tour burnout and has handled it poorly. My issue isn\'t so much with Osaka herself, though, as with the bizarre way the media has tried to inflate her struggle with burnout into a watershed moment for mental health in sports. Like there was a period in history before Osaka dropped out of the French Open because she doesn\'t like press conferences and then the post-Osaka dropped out era that we now inhabit. Another example of this nutty behavior is how the media treated Simone Biles after she dropped out of the competition at the Olympics. She was perfectly right to not attempt those dangerous moves if she she didn\'t feel sorted, but the media again reacted as if the Red Sea had parted. When Sunisa Lee won the all-around gold medal at Tokyo (a truly impressive triumph), I read articles that actually said that while it was great what Lee did, it wasn\'t as big an achievement as Biles dropping out. (Reality is often stranger than any fiction.) One Wapo writer actually wrote that because Biles had dropped out ""everyone in the world was now reassessing their priorities."" Umm... no. Nobody did that. All that happened was a lone gymnast whom everyone expected to compete at the Olympics decided not to compete because she didn\'t feel right. End of story. No cultural earthquake. And with Osaka, she\'s just the latest tennis player to experience burnout and need some time away from the game. That\'s all.', 'Will this lady please go away. Get medication, a therapist, and just retire. ', 'Long before Osaka’s public admission of her mental health struggles, another pro tennis player, Noah Rubin, sought to show the trials of less well known men and women on the tour. These are players who might languish for years at the bottom of the rankings, forced to qualify for tournaments, often traveling alone, in less than luxurious conditions, and who struggle to pay for coaching let alone a therapist. Those of us who follow his Instagram account now know much more about the discrepancy between a player like Osaka and ones like Rubin. When shown the enormous sacrifices these independent contractors make, the inevitable conclusion is they do it for love of the sport, something Osaka has admittedly lost. It’s hard to find a massive amount of sympathy for someone who has reached the pinnacle of her sport and who could easily afford to take some time off to sort herself privately. The contrast with Lilah Fernandez, whose joy at playing might only be equaled but the sacrifices she and her family have made, was notable. ', 'Male and females tennis players and professionals support Osaka and speak of the pressures on athletes and the legitimacy of their mental health issues, and commenters troll her. ', 'Clearly, sport has become too competitive, if the best players succumb to the mental strain.  Maybe sports need to remake themselves in a kinder model, where winning is no longer the goal, but instead it is about community and partnership and loving your opponent, rather than trying to ""beat"" them.  Such a terrible term, so violent.\n\nWhy can\'t the all just share the honor of participating?', 'No one should be surprised that the anxiety that Naomi Osaka experienced over participating in press conferences has arisen within her tennis game. The underlying dynamic of the anxiety is not driven by being questioned in a press conference over her performances. The threat that she experiences to her sense of self-worth by not performing perfectly would eventually manifest itself in her tennis matches regardless of whether she ever had to conduct a press conference. But it is also highly unlikely that Ms. Osaka will overcome her anxiety by taking a break from tennis. She should obviously continue with counseling, but the only way to conquer her anxiety is by actually confronting it and by taking on that anxiety in the actual playing of the tennis match. She needs to experience the worst that can happen and then learn that it is not the worst - that she can survive it. No break from tennis will ever allow her to overcome the anxiety that she experiences when playing a tennis match. I imagine that if she takes a break from tennis that she will never return. ', 'I’m pretty certain if the press left her alone - including writing this article - it might be easier for her to reconcile her struggles with her private and professional life. I had a career in finance, on a trading floor on Wall Street. It was competitive and cutthroat. If I had to do a press room interview after every day where my wins and losses were scored openly by people who could only write but not do what I did. At the age of 23… I’m damn certain most interviews would have bombed, shortly followed by my career.\n\nI was critiqued enough by those who hired, trained and wanted to optimize my skills. To have a complete outsider who just sits in the stands think up dumb stuff and then asks it in a public forum that never dies on YouTube…I know I would have taken another path. The press may not have set out to wreck a young persons career and happiness, but it really looks like they might be winning this contest. A contest Naomi Osaka could have never trained for. She was hitting 10,000 balls a week in her teens, refining here talent to be muscle memory, but never being trained in the art of nasty questioning. Again, by those who have no sporting talent. The press need to pack this box of tricks up and send it to be trashed. They may win this battle, but they are going to lose the war. Players will stop doing interviews and just send social media about what matter to them… what now hacks?', 'Awww poor little millionaire rich girl.... Boo hoo....', 'Sounds like you are the one whining. Jealous of her income?', ""Couldn't she just be a spokesperson for one of the big pharma firms? "", ""Couldn't we solve this by giving all losers a trophy?"", ""It isn't about the trophy. Athletes, especially those groomed from childhood to focus 100% on a sport and nothing else, lost the ability to identify with anything but the sport. Anyone whose identity is that closely tied to their work is at risk, but especially athletes and veterans. It can also happen to mothers when their children leave home. "", ""Let Osaka heL in her home country of Japan. And black folks don't need her help. We'd like the masks back. Leave already. Bye."", 'Osaka never seems to be enjoying herself on court. 50 million dollars a year, 8 million dollar Beverly Hills home, people doing her laundry, posing for Sports Illustrated, and Vougue for money is curious, she has it made by most people’s standard yet she appears to be a very unhappy person.\nI just don’t get the word “brave” being tossed around for her.\nMental issues yes, brave, no', 'Brave? Mighty Mouse is brave. This just bat chit.', 'I think the bravery comes in her honesty about what she is going through. She could feign physical injury and no one would say anything, but she puts it out there and some people are extremely vulgar and abusive in their comments. It takes courage for her to continue to be open and honest in the face of the 24x7 toxicit of social media. ', 'Seems obvious Osaka is not suited to the life of a professional tennis player.\nIf she finds something else, out of the spotlight , to do maybe she will be happier...and so will we. ', 'Please just go away Osaka. We don’t need to hear any more about it. If you truly are struggling, use your tremendous resources to get help. Stop sharing everything with the whole world. Most of us don’t care. And it only looks as though you’re trying to stay in the public eye for the wrong reasons. I guess being a great tennis player wasn’t enough for you.  How sad.', 'She should hire John McEnroe as a mental health consultant. He learned to convert his agitation into an asset. ', ""She's another zoomer who never learned how to lose. Normal people lose quite often, and we learn how to deal with it. "", 'The problem people have with Ms.O is not about mental health. Everyone has their own personal, professional and social  mental issues. It has been the handling of herself that people object to. Starting at the French Open and moving  onto Wimbledon, to the Olympics and now at the US Open, with a very short stop in Cincinnati were she pledged her winnings of just $24,000 to Haiti, she has continued to say the wrong things badly and to play sub-par tennis. The public was also put off that during this time she came out on the covers of almost every magazine, giving interviews  and was seemly free of any anxiety, nervousness or depression as she was freely shown wearing bikinis and various fashions. The juxtaposition of these two was not taken well and was bad timing on her part. Why show disrespect to reporters and the French Open organizers by blaming them for so called mental problems? Knowing that a flood of magazines were soon to be on news stands? In addition the WTA for the last 20 years has provided a full time staff dedicated to athletes mental health. Obviously Ms.O did not avail herself to this free benefit. She would rather go public hoping for sympathy and pity. Instead she got a tsunami of criticism and loathing that swept her off her feet. So much so that she copied a PR stunt from Novak Djokovic, and gave a little girl one of her Olympic pins that she just happen to have in her racket bag. Fans didn’t buy it and saw right through her phony play. Now at the US Open she has opened the curtain to show her true petulant self along with her now signature cry scenes. No one is holding their breathe waiting for when she comes back to tennis. Players know how to beat her by getting her frustrated, out of sync to where she is unable to control the match. She is a bore and the fans, too, are not happy when she wins.', 'Celebrate weakness!! Lol. What a soft generation of media and the athletes they cover. ', '🍦', 'I don’t understand the thought Osaka is weak or thinks she’s entitled. She has shown just the opposite.  What people are missing is that it isn’t the tennis that is the problem.  \n\nShe clearly doesn’t have a support system to help her navigate the unreasonable pressure and expectations on her.  Pressure and obligations coming from herself and others.  Pressure and obligations not related to tennis.   If she is serious about wanting to be a tennis player, it is the non-tennis stuff she should be stepping away from not tennis. ', 'No one has said tennis was the problem, where did you hear that? What is she if she’s not weak or privileged? And also,her mental health issues are not what has people disliking her so much. She has by far all the financial means to help her physical and mental health. But instead she chooses to go public to cry, complain, blame others, self loathing, cry, self pity, disrespect fellow players and the entire sport of tennis (remember the French Open?). She’s a basket case but it holds no water with her petulant attitude. Her public demeanor, lack of honesty and backward social behavior is the problem.', 'STOP AND DESIST!!!', 'What to make of Osaka?  If she needs to deal with mental health issues, she is going to have to grow up, make that decision herself and follow through.  Her ""team"" has not been very effective in this regard and in fact at times seems to be making things worse for whatever reasons.  From all appearances, Osaka is an incredible talent who has lived in a pampered protective bubble, and mental health issues or not, she comes off as a self-absorbed brat.  No one wants to see her complain about doing a press conference and then run off to promote her own brand while disdaining the work required to promote the brand of the sport that has made her rich and famous.  She also has made several egregious mistakes on social media including her ill informed and reprehesible broad based accusation that police are committing genocide against black people.  Someone on her team nees to have a very frank discussion with her but perhaps the Osaka gravy train has a little too much gravy for those involved.', 'I agree!', 'Agree!', ""She plays tennis, she can do as she pleases.  If she were a young athlete signed to a professional team, she would need to keep playing or wreck her career.  Obviously I don't know her, but I would say keep playing.  Only wanting to play when you're at the top of your game and winning isn't how life works.  You have to show up every day, some good some bad, and the experiences make you better.  "", 'I just watched Fernandez take down another former champion.  She may soon allow the media to care about others besides Osaka and stories like this one will be considered old news. ', 'Osaka may just need a new coach who will tell her not to try and bash every single shot 100 MPH.  Watching concrete feet Halep and concrete feet Kerber lose today, it is obvious they need new coaches.  Paying a coach to clap for you is ridiculous.

That's a problem ."", 'She needs to learn to deal with crowds who may be cheering for her opponent.', '“... I don’t feel happy; I feel more like a relief...” Parents, hoping the best for their child, boost his or her ego. Osaka feels her superego is running is emotional life.

That should really help her social skills ', 'So she needs a misandrist and a racist, that should really help in improving her tennis as well as social skills.', 'Osaka, who plays for Japan, is not likely to listen to Serena.', 'She would probably benefit from taking a year or two off, travelling the world, and then coming back to tennis with greater perspective. Other players, such as Andre Agassi and Jennifer Capriati, took hiatuses from tennis due to their personal issues, and then came back and had great success well into their 30s. Most tennis players are pushed into the sport almost from the time they are old enough to start talking, and have had nothing close to a normal childhood. Even star basketball and football players in the US at least attend high school and (usually) some college. ', 'And the obvious current model is Ash Barty, who stepped away from tennis for close to two years in order to “have a normal life”. Her performance since her return shows that she made a good choice. Hopefully Naomi can do something similar. I wish her the best.', 'She, Ms.O has burned too many bridges and fans and the tennis world have long memories. Plus there will be better, more enjoyable and likeable players to come along.', 'From like to loathe. When she beat Serena at US Open to her recent immaturity and lack of professionalism. Grow up Osaka!', 'In an above comment Ms.O is stated to blame Serena for her mental health problems. That is terrible to put the blame on a fellow player. No one should believe or trust this person. And all along it was told that the mean reporters were the cause of her problems. Wow!', ""It's hard to get real sympathetic to Osaka because she's a person in her early 20s who's already worth tens of millions of dollars. Hundreds of millions of people in the world gladly would exchange their lives for hers and manage to deal with the angst that seems to be always with her.  Sympathizing with Osaka is like sympathizing with mega billionaire Jeff Bezos because his feelings are hurt because some people don't consider him an astronaut after his recent stunt. If I were Osaka, I would quit playing tennis and become a private person, hopefully using her boatload of money to help other people rather than constantly navel gazing. "", 'She actually does use her money to help people. She had a tennis academy in Haiti and donated her winnings to the country after the earthquake. \n\nComparing her to Bezos doesn’t make sense. Bezos has exploited people for years to make billions and has presided over a company that discourages unionization and employee opportunities for advancement. Osaka made her money through winning tournaments, Grand Slams and endorsements. Also keep in mind that tennis players use their winnings to pay for their coaches, her own team, health insurance, etc. it doesn’t mean she’s poor but she’s hardly a billionaire.\n\nThat aside, money can’t buy you happiness and self confidence. I hope Naomi finds what she needs within herself to overcome her happiness and self doubt. ', 'You are correct, she’s only a multi-millionaire. And you are proud of her for donating a mere $24,000 to Haiti!?  And a tennis academy is the last thing people need in Haiti right now! This only continues to show how out of touch with reality she has become. And it looks like she is not getting her money’s worth paying those expenses you listed. She hasn’t played beyond the third round or won any tournaments in almost two years (coaches$$), her”team”has done nothing in projecting a positive, likeable image (own team$$). And she must have signed up for the cheapest health insurance as we all know where she stands on that issue (-$$). Why do you even care about someone you don’t even know? The rest of us like to bash her not because we are jealous, far from it, but for thinking she is somehow better than the rest of us. She shows no humility, gratitude, graciousness or appreciation nor does she take responsibility or give respect to others.', ""Comparing Naomi Osaka's circumstances to our ordinary own is not useful.  She is probably the best women's tennis player on the planet or pretty darn close.  As such, she has opportunities we don't have.  She also has to navigate not-so-obvious traps we don't encounter.  Her trials, her comportment, her wins and losses are dissected in ways we are unlikely to experience.  She is an intensely shy person trying to live an intensely public, and publicly invasive, life.  She was fitted into a tennis slot as a toddler; her parents, handlers, agents, sponsors have all been motivated by, and profited from, her brilliance as a tennis player, clearly not with her best interests in mind.  I personally believe she suffers from a severe anxiety disorder and I suspect that her personal relationships are not what she needs them to be.  She should just fire everyone around her, take a good, long break, and start again at whatever ignites and soothes her inner sanctum."", ""From your description, which I mostly agree with, Osaka's shy personality does not fit well with her profession as a celebrity athlete.

However she seems simultaneously sheltered and immature yet also overexposed and lacking good PR advice. It's clear they've depended on the promise of her potential tennis stardom to bring financial benefits to the whole family, as was revealed by a lawsuit brought by Osaka's ex-coach in her teenage years. It's the same story over and over again with tennis parents however loving they might be.

It was always about covering up for her struggles to perform in the spotlight.\n\nShe is a very immature person who has a lot of growing up to do. Unfortunately many superstars in tennis live and breath and work nothing but tennis 24/7 since they are 2 or 3 years old and eventually the money doesn't matter anymore and they lose the desire to live that life.

I didn't want to let people I loved down. If someone hasn't lived a sport 24/7 it may be hard to understand. I am a senior citizen now and am grateful I wasn't playing in the time of social media.

It is just a game."" Her off court responsibities are just adding up and taking their toll on her too, and she would be better off dropping some of the demands on her time.
