Doing so was called 'wild analysis' when psychiatrists attempted it - when nurses, aides, or the general public ascribed diagnoses it was considered just plain ignorant and rude.

The 2 thought systems are upside down and backwards of each other, yet we try to hold both in our mind which splits it--the tremendous inner conflict rarely becomes to the human mind\'s concious awareness since the inner critic (your ego) hides from your awareness.

', 'I think Leylah turned 19 on September 6.  It was part of her last interview.', 'Oh yes you and the writer are correct. The NPR reporter said 18. And the other doesn’t turn 19 until November. ', 'It’s a pleasure to watch their tennis and see their joy on the court.  And it’s a welcome relief from the drama story lines that we have been treated to with Williams and Osaka. ', ""Didn't we just see two other young female tennis players exalted to great heights only to be later sympathized as victims of Too Much Pressure created by that very exaltation?\n\nI hope it's not deja vu all over again."", ""Yes Laylah is good but I can't stand the narcissism...please, drop that Novak-like salute to yourself after you score a point."", 'This behavior is greatly encouraged by almost all the current commentary', 'I hear and see it differently. I agree that Novak will try to encourage applause for himself. And it looks pathetic. But Fernandez is reacting to the spontaneous cheering for her and she is joining in accepting the applause. There’s a big difference. ', 'Novak’s problem is there is not a “major” played in Serbia or anywhere near Eastern Europe. The man is clearly the greatest tennis player of all time, even if he loses Sunday. But he never has a home match where his countrymen and women can unabashedly cheer his every shot. He is always the favorite going against the underdog. And when people are neutral, they love to cheer for the underdog. And they want to see close, exciting matches. So Novak is forced to coax their cheers, but does so after displaying his brilliance on the court. He seems to take the naysayers personally, and they include many Roger and Rafa fans who prefer to see Novak lose. But like a true champion he draws strength from it. Calling him a “narcissist” suggests he is pretty much like a Donald Trump. I don’t see that at all. Novak certainly yearns for the accolades, the applause. But unlike Trump, when it comes to his on court performance, Novak deserves them. ', 'Novak deserves all the credit that the sports world can give.  He will go down as the greatest. But he is too thin skinned and he doesn’t have the charisma of the others.  He’s more Lendl than he is Federer. And Lendl couldn’t say that he was without home nation tournaments but he just wasn’t loved. Same with Novak. ', '""Novak"", unlike the hot headed champs of the past, is not set off by bad calls, it is just his juvenile personality on display. The guy is a putz. ', 'Narcissism? I see joy and exuberance. BTW , it is Leylah not Laylah.', 'Spectacular tennis, but the high point in the two teens triumphant tear through the tennis tournament was the loss by aging A Kerber. Unlike looser #17 seed whose 6-1 6-3 defeat scored better than it deserved vanishing from the court with the speed of a wayward quark falling into a black hole, in defeat, Kerber was the happiest tennis pro I have ever seen at the end of a match. Kerber and the kid hugged and chatted and 36 year old Kerber, perhaps for the last time, slowly ambled off the court with hugs and kisses to the cheering crowd. Kerber explained, ‘She made me play the greatest tennis of my life. I never had so much fun on the court’. Indeed, sometimes it is not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game.', 'I think Angie realized very quickly that she would probably not win that match, that the torch was being passed. All her good shots were coming back with interest and often at impossible angles', 'How fast DOES a wayward quark fall into a back hole?', 'Infinitely slowly.', ""Leon Fleisher, who would have been universally hailed as the greatest pianist of the late 20th C had he not suffered a psychosomatic paralysis of his right hand for most of what would have been his greatest years, commented near the end of his life, when asked what his biggest mistake was, “practicing too much”.\n\nLast year, during the abbreviated NBA, Baseball, and NHL seasons, the talking heads repeatedly remarked with astonishment at the high level of play the teams put on without playing much and with so little practice.\n\nNow the high level of play at this year's Open is obvious to all, after one shut down season followed by an abbreviated seasons-- again, too little practice gets the best. Savor this season, for, come the return to “normal” , you will never again see such high quality tennis."", ""The sheer joy of these women is a vast relief from the man heading into the men's final."", 'What a great surprise, and I am hopeful they will not burn out as so many teen queens of tennis have. It has been a joy to watch them win, and I won\'t see a ""loser"" in the final. One will win the title, but both are winners in my book. \n\nAnd it\'s great to see grace and agility return to women\'s tennis, as well as hear far fewer grunts and groans. I admire women\'s power tennis stars, but this style seems a bit more fun. And easier to listen to. ', 'Perhaps this is one US Open I should have watched.  No losers in this match.  Being from north of the border a little partial to Leylah.  ', ""I'm no sports fan. But I find the success of these two unlikely youngsters a monument to inspiration."", 'My money is on Fernandez, because she wins in continents represented 3-2.', 'The prize money cited is but a part of the total winnings each have so far received.  Every round they have played in has an increasing payoff for each player.  By my calculation, excluding the championship match payoff, each has earned 1,750,000 just to get there. ', ""That's not how it works. The prize money is not cumulative; you win the amount allocated to the round when you lost."", 'Leylah, Emma and Naomi all have Asian tiger moms.  What does this say about tigers to young girls/teens?', ""Coco Gauff isn't exactly chopped liver.  She is developing as a player and I hope, as a well adjusted human being.\n\nLet's see how Fernandez does when she had the pressure of being a top seed and the press stops fawning over her."", 'The “nothing to lose” excuse for knocking off world No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka, No. 3 Naomi Osaka, No. 5 Elina Svitolina, Olympic champion Belinda Bencic and three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber sounds like a lame excuse for the losers and giving no credit to these fresh new winners!  ', 'If you have never been in one-on-one competition in a sport, you might not understand how liberating it can be that nobody really expects you to win a contest.', ""Don't have ESPN, but can't wait to see the stories. Should be the best match in ages. The future is here."", 'Try the app.', 'Probably the best sports story of the year, certainly the most unlikely. Should be a very interesting match. They are both such Cinderella stories, hard to pick a favorite. ', 'Women tennis has a great future!  The match tomorrow at 4:00 will be fantastic!  ', ' Fernandez just made a crip sign.', 'Canadian Leylah is well above that.', 'You might know what that is.  I very much doubt that Leylah Fernandez has any idea.', ""Nonsense.  She's acknowledging her mother and younger sister by pointing at them with her one free hand.""]"
