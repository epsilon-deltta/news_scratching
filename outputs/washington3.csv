Inada was axed from the Cabinet a couple years ago for covering up the dangers present for Japanese peacekeepers in South Sudan when she was Minister of Defense, and Koike already tried running for office when she launched a party to challenge the LDP in 2017 and was routed, coming in third behind the center-left Constitutional Democratic Party.

4,"In the NFL, speed has always mattered. Now it’s everything.",,,,"['A trend developed in the 90’s in college football based partly on the success Florida State had under Bobby Bowden by using many of their best athletes on defense. Defensive ends became more explosive and better edge rushers. Linebackers could run down the fastest backs (compare the 40 times in the chart of those 2 positions at the end of the article). Safeties had to run as fast or nearly as fast, as cornerbacks against 3 and 4 receivers sets. Commenters have rightly noted pure speed isn’t everything and that’s why the article references “football speed”. Also in terms of slower players who excelled at QB like Brady and Peyton Manning? Their synapses fire quicker than mere mortals. The moment they recognize an open (or even well covered) receiver and the coverage, until they unload their cannon is faster by thousands of a second than the average QB. With today’s quicker defenses, that has become an even more important weapon.', ""On a broken play, an opposing linebacker picked up the dead ball and sprinted to the end zone.
